    <p>The University of Texas at Austin</p>
    <p class="subtitle">Graduation approaches as I take the final steps to getting my undergraduate degree. I'm studying Management Information Systems and Computer Science and have developed some great passions and skills from the coursework. I'm looking at a busy upcoming semester and am excited to be a TA for MIS 325: Database Management.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Personal projects</p>
    <p class="subtitle">After years of starting random creative projects, I want to put more effort into following through and creating tangible results. This means I'll be spending more time playing the piano, learning to sew, and designing games/apps.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Career</p>
    <p class="subtitle">I'm currently working part-time at Apple and LPL Financial. Both are great companies and have allowed me to grow professionally and develop my technical skills. As graduation approaches, I'll be exploring post-grad career opportunities.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Reading</p>
    <p class="subtitle">Check out my <a href="books.html">reading list</a> if you want to see exactly what I'm reading these days. I want to cover a lot of the literary classics but I've also been reading about world religion.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Cybersecurity</p>
    <p class="subtitle">After taking a introductory Cybersecurity course at UT, I've become fascinated by the field. I've been spending a lot of time on <a href="https://www.hackthebox.com/">hackthebox.com</a>, trying to break into every practice machine they have available.</p>
