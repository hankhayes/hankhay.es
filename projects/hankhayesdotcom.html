    <p>How</p>
    <p class="subtitle text">Building a personal site has been on the to-do list for a long time now. This is just a static site built with HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of Javascript. Every line of code is custom, including the style sheet. I consider myself a design thinker and having a good design sense, but this was a learning project and I wanted to focus on the coding more than the UI. We have <a class="inline" href="https://www.ibuildmyideas.com">Jordan Springer and his personal website</a> to thank for the UI inspiration.</p>
    <p class="subtitle text">I wrote a blog post for students (or anyone really) who want to do the same thing, <a class="inline" href="https://hankhayes.substack.com/p/coming-soon">which can be found here</a>! It covers how to take advantage of a free Azure subscription to publish a static web app. The repository for this site, and its previous iterations, are public on <a class="inline" href="https://github.com/hankhayes/hankhayes.com">my GitHub</a> as well, so check it out if you're interested in doing the same.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Why</p>
    <p class="subtitle text">Web Application Development (MIS 333K) is one of my favorite courses I've taken at UT. 333K covered building web applications for business purposes, but UI was out of the scope of the class. The fast paced nature of the class didn't really allow time for learning or experimenting with CSS either. I decided that building this site from scratch would give me a chance to explore UI design and learn about CSS.</p>
